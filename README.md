# Threat Intelligence Dashboard

A comprehensive web-based dashboard for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats in real-time.

## Overview

The Threat Intelligence Dashboard is an interactive platform designed for security professionals to monitor global and local threats, analyze attack patterns, and access tools for threat intelligence analysis. The dashboard combines real-time data with comprehensive visualization tools to provide actionable insights for cybersecurity teams.

## Key Features

- **üîç Real-time Threat Monitoring**: Track and visualize security incidents as they occur
- **üìä Interactive Visualizations**: Analyze threat data through dynamic charts and graphs 
- **üõ°Ô∏è [CVE Database](https://cve.mitre.org/) Integration**: Search and filter the latest vulnerabilities and exposures
- **üß∞ Advanced Analysis Tools**: Extract IOCs, perform topic modeling, and identify entities
- **üåè Global & Local Monitoring**: View both worldwide threats and Nepal-specific security incidents
- **üîß Customizable Settings**: Personalize dashboard appearance and behavior
- **üåì Dark/Light Modes**: Toggle between themes for different working environments
- **üîî Smart Notifications**: Receive context-aware alerts about critical security events

## Dashboard Sections

### Main Dashboard

The main dashboard provides a global overview of threat intelligence, featuring:

- **Threat Distribution Chart**: Breakdown of different threat types
- **Attack Types Chart**: Analysis of various attack methodologies
- **Geographic Distribution**: Visual representation of threat origins
- **Severity Breakdown**: Classification of threats by severity level
- **Recent CVEs**: Latest vulnerabilities from the [CVE database](https://cve.mitre.org/)
- **Threat Topics**: AI-generated topic clusters from threat intelligence
- **Identified Entities**: Automatically extracted entities from threat reports

### Analysis Tools

Interactive tools for threat intelligence analysis:

- **[IOC Extractor](https://github.com/kabu631/Threat-Intelligence_System/blob/main/src/processors/ioc_extractor.py)**: Extract Indicators of Compromise from text
- **[Topic Modeling](https://github.com/kabu631/Threat-Intelligence_System/blob/main/src/models/topic_model.py)**: Analyze themes in threat intelligence reports
- **[Entity Recognition](https://github.com/kabu631/Threat-Intelligence_System/blob/main/src/models/ner_model.py)**: Identify and categorize entities in security documents
- **[CVE Search](https://github.com/kabu631/Threat-Intelligence_System/blob/main/src/collectors/cve_collector.py)**: Search and filter the CVE database

### Nepal Monitor

- **Dashboard**: Global threat overview and intelligence summaries  
- **Analysis Tools**: Interactive tools for threat intelligence analysis  
- **Nepal Monitor**: Nepal-specific threat monitoring  
- **Settings**: Dashboard configuration options

### Dashboard Interaction

- **Charts**: Hover over chart elements to see detailed information  
- **Tables**: Click on table rows to see detailed information about entries  
- **Search & Filter**: Use search boxes and filters to find specific information  
- **Tools**: Enter text into analysis tool sections to process threat intelligence data

### Customization

Access the settings page to customize:

- Toggle between light and dark mode  
- Enable or disable real-time notifications  
- Configure API connections

## Configuration

### API Configuration

The dashboard connects to a backend API for data. Configure the connection in the Settings page:

1. Navigate to the Settings page  
2. Update the "API Base URL" field with your API server address  
3. Update the "WebSocket URL" field for real-time data  
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
API_PORT=9000
STATIC_PORT=8080
DEBUG=True
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## API Documentation

The backend API supports the following endpoints:

- `/health`: API health check  
- `/global/summary`: Get global threat summary  
- `/global/events`: Get global threat events  
- `/nepal/summary`: Get Nepal-specific threat summary  
- `/nepal/events`: Get Nepal-specific threat events  
- `/tools/extract-ioc`: Extract IOCs from text  
- `/tools/topic-model`: Perform topic modeling on text  
- `/tools/extract-entities`: Extract entities from text  
- `/cve/search`: Search the CVE database
